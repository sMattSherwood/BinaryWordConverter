This project will allow the user to enter text and the web page will directly translate it to binary that web browsers use for text

overview of project
This project was created with HTML, CSS, and javascript

the html document utlizes two text box containers to A. allow user to type what ever text they want and B. copy the binary

the main javascript file uses a listener to see what character the user pressed and through a switch statement selects the proper binary text to display

the copy text javascript file then allows the user to copy the text and store it in their clipboard.
